**Card types** are a way of grouping specific cards across different [suits](/en/hanafuda/suits) in the [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) deck. If the 12 suits in a hanafuda deck are analogous to the 13 values in a Western deck, the 4 hanafuda card types can be said to be analogous to the Western deck's 4 suits. However, **each card type contains a different number of cards and is distributed differently across the suits.** 

In almost all [fishing games](/en/hanafuda/games), cards of a given type are more likely to form yaku with one another.
# Standard Types
There are generally considered to be 4 distinct card types for the purpose of most hanafuda games. The way to which these are referred varies widely, but their groupings tend to be the same, with occasional exceptions. They are often referred to by their values in the game of [Hachi-Hachi](/en/hanafuda/games/hachi-hachi), especially in Japanese.

### [Brights](/en/hanafuda/types/brights)
*Those cards are usually the most important cards in games, with the highest value. For instance, at 88, they are each worth **20** points.*
