Mushi-Bana (虫花 - むしばな, lit. “insect flowers”) refers to a particular style of hanafuda deck that lacks the [![monthicon_6.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_6.png =20x)Peony](/en/hanafuda/suits/peony) and [![monthicon_7.png](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_7.png =20x)Bush Clover](/en/hanafuda/suits/bush-clover) suits, thus containing only 40 rather than the usual 48 cards. In most other respects, this pattern tends to be very similar to the standard [Hachi-Hachi-Bana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/hachihachibana) design. It is said to have originated in the Kansai region of Japan, near Osaka, and is used to play the fishing-type game [Mushi](/en/hanafuda/games/mushi), which is popular in that area.
