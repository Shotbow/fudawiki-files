![Icon for month 1](/hanafuda/icons/monthicon_1.png =25x)Pine [松 - まつ, *matsu*] is the name of a [suit](/en/hanafuda/suits) in traditional [hanafuda](/en/hanafuda) decks. It is generally taken to be the first suit, representing the month of January [一月 - いちがつ, *ichigatsu*] or the numeral 1. The cards in this suit all feature pine trees. There are two Chaff cards, one Poetry Ribbon, and one Bright. The Bright card of the Pine suit features a crane [鶴 - つる *tsuru*] among the pines as well as a red sun in the top corner of the card. 

# Crane with Sun

The Crane, being one of the only 5 Bright cards in the standard deck, is important for making high-scoring yaku in many games, as well as being desirable in its own right in many games that assign point values to individual cards.

In [Koi-Koi](/en/hanafuda/games/koi-koi), the Crane plays a role in the series of Bright yaku. In [Mushi](/en/hanafuda/games/mushi), it is necessary for making the two most valuable yaku: with the other 4 Brights it can form "5 Brights," and when combined with the [Bush Warbler](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#bush-warbler) and [Curtain](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#flower-viewing-curtain) it forms "3 Brights." In [Six Hundred](/en/hanafuda/games/roppyakken) it can be used to make "Four Brights" (which is an instant win), "Pine, Paulownia, Baldy," (which combines the card with the [Phoenix](/en/hanafuda/suits/paulownia#phoenix) and [Moon](/en/hanafuda/suits/susuki-grass#full-moon) cards) and "3 Brights" (in the same combination used in Mushi).

# Poetry Ribbon

In the [standard hanafuda design](/en/hanafuda/patterns/hachihachibana), the Ribbon on this card features the phrase *aka-yoroshi* written in hiragana, using a hentaigana character in place of the standard "ka." This refers to one name of the yaku known more commonly today as *aka-tan,* or "Red Ribbons," which includes this card as well as the Ribbons of the [Plum Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/plum-blossom#poetry-ribbon) and [Cherry Blossom](/en/hanafuda/suits/cherry-blossom#poetry-ribbon) suits, and is featured in a large number of games.

# Chaff

In the [Echigo-Bana](/en/hanafuda/patterns/echigobana) pattern, each of these will carry one half of the following *waka* poem composed by Minamoto no Muneyuki "at  a poetry contest held in the palace of the Empress in the Kanpyō era" (889-897).
